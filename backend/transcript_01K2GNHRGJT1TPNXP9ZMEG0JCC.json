  "content": "Steve: This meeting is being recorded.\nHenry Dornier: Let's see.\nHenry Dornier: Or.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah, I think waiting on a couple more here.\nHenry Dornier: I figure we can spend some time talking about some of the notes you sent over over email, if that works.\nHenry Dornier: Because it's just easier to discuss live than over email, I think.\nSteve: Yeah, 100%, man.\nSteve: 100%.\nHenry Dornier: And we'd love to see a little more.\nHenry Dornier: I think.\nHenry Dornier: I haven't seen the latest in terms of what the product experience looks like today and what you guys want it to look like.\nHenry Dornier: Also give me some more context on how we can best sort of support those needs.\nSteve: Yeah, cool.\nSteve: I'll see if I'll just log in.\nSteve: In.\nSteve: Because there was the other one, the one I think Carl pinged you about, and you said a lot of people just do the iframe, which we have in the platform already for certain things.\nHenry Dornier: Yep.\nSteve: Talent management.\nSteve: Hang on.\nSteve: Jobs.\nSteve: But then, of course, it doesn't have any jobs.\nSteve: Hang on.\nSteve: I was gonna say.\nSteve: Yeah, we sort of.\nSteve: We enrich the candidate data, though.\nSteve: We sort of pluck the.\nSteve: Pluck the bits we love out of Delpha Run and then stick some extra data around it.\nSteve: And we only send a curated list through to the customers for this particular Carl's talking about.\nSteve: So it's not everyone that is in the project or the job that the client gets to see.\nSteve: Okay, that makes sense.\nSteve: While I talk, apparently I can't do two things at once today.\nSteve: All right.\nSteve: Thomas was saying you guys are going gangbusters in the U.S. it's taking off.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah, it's been.\nHenry Dornier: It's been pretty hectic, but, yeah, all good.\nHenry Dornier: Just closed another big deal with fairly large public company, actually.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah.\nHenry Dornier: To do a lot of their help, a lot of their recruiting globally.\nHenry Dornier: So excited about that.\nHenry Dornier: Not in Australia, actually, or not in apac, but more in sort of like Europe and Americas.\nSteve: Yeah, but.\nHenry Dornier: But yeah, it's.\nHenry Dornier: It's been fun.\nSteve: Nice.\nSteve: And so that's their internal team.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah, so it's their internal team, exactly.\nHenry Dornier: Rather than outsourced.\nHenry Dornier: So they're just using the platform directly.\nHenry Dornier: And this is actually one of our partnerships with Fountain, who's another one of our sort of integration partners.\nHenry Dornier: So they were the ones I was kind of referencing, actually, when it comes to the way that they're integrating the iFrame and all that fun stuff.\nHenry Dornier: But we can talk about more about what that would look like.\nSteve: Yeah, so we already.\nSteve: If I just.\nSteve: I don't know where HUMDI is.\nSteve: Maybe humdi's been hit by a bus.\nSteve: Anyway, I'll just show you this.\nSteve: So I don't know whether the folks have showed you, but we already, from an admin perspective.\nSteve: And you guys.\nHenry Dornier: Of course manage all their interviews here, I suppose.\nSteve: Well, this is.\nSteve: This is.\nSteve: Hang on, let me come to one where I've actually got mine.\nSteve: So this is for the Janes, the Lizards, the Humvees and the.\nSteve: Those guys where we're managing the projects and the like from there.\nSteve: So our.\nSteve: Our basic flow, if you haven't sort of seen it before, starts with a requisition or request that'll go through its life cycle.\nSteve: A lot of the stuff that we capture on here isn't super relevant in the alpha run, but it all sort of builds up that candidate picture in particularly things around monthly employment costs, you know, the cost of our subscriptions and security fees, all that sort of stuff.\nSteve: Stuff in there that doesn't really need to go across.\nSteve: So we capture that as we go.\nSteve: Won't show you the workflow that gets approved.\nSteve: It goes off, it creates say a job in our ATS at the same time.\nSteve: Then we kick off a in alpha run and then the two come back as the candidates go through.\nSteve: When we bring them back into our.\nSteve: Let's see if I can find a job with some stuff in it.\nSteve: As we bring them back into our.\nSteve: We grab the good or the bits that we like out of Alpha run.\nSteve: I like it.\nSteve: I have something in here.\nSteve: The bits that we like out of alpha run and the other bits that we augment with as well.\nSteve: So we have the AI interview here.\nSteve: Of course, I managed to pick one where she doesn't have any and that brings down like this is where the audio gets done and things along those lines.\nSteve: And then we've got all these other details in here as well.\nSteve: See if I can find another one.\nSteve: Another job where whilst the AI stuff is here we go.\nSteve: No, but we stick all of it in alongside of that.\nSteve: Makes sense.\nSteve: So down here we'll have the outcomes and the interviews and the videos and all that sort of stuff.\nSteve: But that's why I was saying we can't really just embed the whole iframe for the project because it's like might be five out of the 300 candidates that are in there that we're pushing through and then we're enriching it with a bunch of other stuff that isn't in alpha run at the same time.\nSteve: But that particular one Karl was talking about.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah, so what.\nHenry Dornier: What some of our customers do is they will embed the specific view for that candidate.\nSteve: So.\nHenry Dornier: So it's Almost as if you were looking interviews and just reviewing.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah, you can almost render this whole thing in the UI there.\nHenry Dornier: I almost wonder if, if we do that, are we.\nSteve: Because we don't pass through this other stuff.\nHenry Dornier: Like.\nSteve: A lot of the.\nSteve: Like we don't through some of the.\nSteve: I mean, this one probably wouldn't go through anyway.\nSteve: But we don't pass through some of these qualification things and other bids and bods.\nSteve: Like we don't do it whole as bolus.\nSteve: We pick the eyes out of the bits that we want, if that makes sense.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah, it would have to be this whole thing.\nHenry Dornier: You can trim out ones that you know are less relevant and of course you wouldn't have to show this for anyone that you.\nHenry Dornier: That doesn't have the right score.\nHenry Dornier: But.\nSteve: Yeah, I mean, you basically just embed Linvu Mai or whatever her name is as the URL in the iframe in there.\nSteve: And is that public?\nSteve: Do they have to be logged in or can that just be shown?\nHenry Dornier: No, you do have to be logged in.\nHenry Dornier: So you would have to have the users with like, you can have them SSO into alpha run, where we can have basically a thing where the out staffer login becomes the login for.\nHenry Dornier: For alpha run, but it would still have to be authenticated.\nSteve: Right.\nSteve: So similar to when we.\nSteve: Well, as I am now, I had to log in, which means we'd have to do.\nHenry Dornier: Where it's, you know, still login, but it is SSO where you log in with your same out staffer account.\nSteve: Yeah, but I then have to get every one of my clients that I want to show a candidate to to log in twice.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah, yeah.\nHenry Dornier: Although they would only have to do this, you know, hopefully once at the beginning of their session because the session tends to last a very long time.\nHenry Dornier: But if they're, you know, if they're logged in here and they do one more login.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah, they would.\nHenry Dornier: They would be good.\nHenry Dornier: But it does take two logins.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah.\nSteve: Now, so one of the.\nSteve: One of Thomas's outcomes that he wants to try and do is make it feel like they're still within our platform if we put a secondary login in there just so they can view what's important is just part of the information.\nSteve: Yeah, that's going to be a weird experience, I reckon.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah.\nHenry Dornier: That said, you will only log in once.\nHenry Dornier: So it's.\nHenry Dornier: It would be.\nHenry Dornier: You wouldn't log in to this window and.\nHenry Dornier: Or, you know, I mean, like, it wouldn't.\nHenry Dornier: It would be shared session across each of these pages.\nHenry Dornier: So if you had them log in at the, at the other tab you were showing me earlier.\nHenry Dornier: It would.\nHenry Dornier: The session is just at the browser.\nSteve: Yeah.\nSteve: No.\nSteve: So customers don't see this.\nSteve: We don't show them that.\nSteve: The only thing that customers see is if I could freaking find one in Alaika's, then go back one.\nSteve: These are all new.\nSteve: I'm broken.\nSteve: Sorry.\nSteve: We just kicked off.\nSteve: We just got rid of job adder, so everything is busted and we're now on recruit CRM.\nHenry Dornier: Thing.\nSteve: Our customer sees this.\nSteve: At the moment it's just this one tab.\nSteve: So they would log in, do whatever they want to do.\nSteve: They go, oh cool.\nSteve: Anita Patel.\nSteve: Cool, let's have a look at her.\nSteve: Great.\nSteve: Gross.\nSteve: Relevant, you know, summary details, AI interview.\nSteve: Oh, I gotta log in again.\nSteve: Why am I logging in again here?\nSteve: That's quite weird to see that particular.\nSteve: I would then assume that as they move through the candidates, because it's a shared session, they wouldn't have to log in again.\nSteve: But no, it'd still be that secondary login on that particular tab, which is what we're trying to avoid.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah, yeah.\nHenry Dornier: So that's the, that's the limitation there.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah.\nHenry Dornier: Certainly replicate what you want for this AI interview here.\nHenry Dornier: This view you can pretty much replicate with the APIs that.\nHenry Dornier: That exist.\nHenry Dornier: I think there was the one thing that, that.\nSteve: Yeah, that's fine.\nSteve: Yeah.\nSteve: The Carl, the way the audio file was hosted, we were having some calls and he's done that stream through.\nSteve: But GCP has short sessions and things along those lines and I think that was the.\nSteve: That's the only limitation we're hitting there.\nSteve: Like this is.\nSteve: This is working.\nSteve: Other than we hit that, I think then audio file limitation around because it's hosted differently.\nHenry Dornier: So is he actually saving the files, the audio files or just trying to do like a pass through from our API?\nSteve: Probably just pass through from the API, I would think.\nSteve: I don't think we're trying to save it.\nHenry Dornier: I think the solution then would be save it, fetch it from us, save it to your database somewhere and then you can play it directly from your database rather than having it pass through with us and then hitting some of those limitations.\nSteve: Yeah, yeah.\nHenry Dornier: I think you should be able to download from the existing link.\nHenry Dornier: I'm not sure we need to add anything more, but I'll confirm with him.\nSteve: No, no, we, we should be able to grab it.\nSteve: I've grabbed a couple of them, that's fine.\nSteve: Okay.\nSteve: I think we just, we were trying to avoid replicating stuff where we don't have to, you Know if it's hanging out on your server and we've got a reference to it.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah, it's not ideal but yeah, sorry.\nSteve: I said it is what it is, man.\nSteve: Yeah, it's all good.\nHenry Dornier: Job management control, editing the qualifications in the interview questions, that is something you, we allow you to control the.\nHenry Dornier: Or send us the job description which we use to generate the job qualifications and the questions but we don't actually expose the rest as you know.\nHenry Dornier: The reason we don't is because as things change in the product potentially over time and as we improve the experience, we don't really want those things to very much.\nHenry Dornier: So that's why most of our or all of our integration partners, they embed again this experience for the clients to then be able to use directly to make edits to.\nHenry Dornier: And that way they can also change things like you know, for example the interview language down there or the voice or whether collaborate like all these different settings which actually get pretty, you know, can get pretty intense.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah, we don't really want folks to have to basically replicate all of that through the API and the UI on their side.\nSteve: Is there, is there some way that we could do a pass through authentication or something so that they're not having to log in again?\nHenry Dornier: I think there's, at some point you hit something where we, we, we will always have some kind of stage where there's going to be a login screen and someone actually has to sign in and even if it's done with an out staffer account, they do end up having to do it twice.\nHenry Dornier: I think, I think that's, that's going to be pretty hard to avoid.\nHenry Dornier: I'll, I'll check with the team on what they.\nHenry Dornier: Because we explored many of the same things with, with another partner and tried to figure out like what, where can we go here?\nHenry Dornier: And like how can we.\nSteve: Yeah, yeah.\nHenry Dornier: Where we landed was like yeah, it's, it's too much of a pain to, to ultimately like try to basically.\nHenry Dornier: Because basically what this makes you do is you basically will have to replicate the entire UI for configurating and showing the results of the interviews which is like not impossible but it's definitely like a pain as, especially as we add more stuff.\nHenry Dornier: You're just always going to be sort of on the back foot in terms of oh we added this new setting now and now this doesn't exist and outside all that stuff.\nHenry Dornier: So that's the challenge.\nHenry Dornier: And you know, I understand the desire to create things to create a really smooth experience for customers but yeah, let Me see, I think on my side, let me see if there's anything we can do to like really to go beyond this.\nHenry Dornier: I don't think there is.\nHenry Dornier: And then I think on your side, maybe it's worth kind of like having that discussion around the trade offs and figuring out if it's really the road you want to go down because, you know, it's possible.\nHenry Dornier: But it is quite a bit more work and I think there'll be some, there will be inevitable limitations with the functionality parity.\nSteve: You've met Thomas, haven't you?\nHenry Dornier: Yes.\nSteve: Okay.\nSteve: Yeah, I think I don't mind any of this.\nSteve: I mean, as long as we can like hide some of this crap because.\nHenry Dornier: That all gets hidden actually.\nHenry Dornier: So in the, in the view that we're talking about.\nHenry Dornier: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.\nHenry Dornier: You're trimming down into the core experience.\nHenry Dornier: So yeah, that would be effectively the focus would be on the configuration of the project.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah, okay.\nSteve: And then, yeah, have a chat.\nSteve: Like if we could somehow avoid the double login.\nSteve: I mean that would be the wild experience.\nSteve: If they could log in there and we can pass a token or something that gets.\nSteve: As they open up the screen or whatever the case is.\nSteve: I'm sure you guys have got more technical geniuses than I am because I'm a bit of a tech toad to have that, that seamless login experience.\nSteve: And then I reckon the sales pitch on Thomas to call his jets and just go, hey, yeah, iframe's okay, that like it'll be a thousand percent easier.\nSteve: Yeah, I think if I'm trying to sell to Thomas, hey, you're going to do this and they're going to have to log in twice.\nSteve: That'll be a hard thing.\nSteve: And he's going to make me build this thing out completely.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah.\nSteve: So what's.\nSteve: Hey man, what's that?\nSteve: You said there's a.\nSteve: What Carl has done here is basically just embed the whole thing.\nSteve: But there's another.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah, so there's a flag that we use which, which I can send over, but it's basically a query parameter on the URL we'd use to make sure that we're going to render the right thing.\nSteve: Oh, wow, cool.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah.\nSteve: Nice.\nSteve: Could you send over?\nSteve: Because I'll still, even though I car card it, I'll still explain and lay out that, hey, we can just embed the like the candidate trimmed candidate view in that thing.\nSteve: Like I don't think they'll take it, but yeah, I don't know, send it over.\nSteve: I'll just point us to The URL where it's on your website.\nSteve: I could probably find it if I bother to look around your website.\nHenry Dornier: No, no, I'll send it over in an email and I'll just give you some examples also of what things actually look like for the partners that have, have implemented it.\nHenry Dornier: So you can get a sense there.\nHenry Dornier: But, but yeah, it's, it's more, more seamless than just like dumping the whole thing in.\nHenry Dornier: So I'll send a follow up there.\nSteve: Yeah, that'd be cool, man.\nSteve: All right, that's cool for school.\nSteve: Thanks.\nHenry Dornier: I think that's where, you know, that's where, frankly, this also just simplifies a lot.\nHenry Dornier: Like, there's a lot of things that, in the API we don't support today that you were also asking about, for example, like changing the advancing or rejecting a particular candidate, which again, you get for free when you embed the iFrame.\nHenry Dornier: But you have to implement if you, if you don't use or you can't implement right now if you don't use.\nHenry Dornier: And honestly not sure when we would add that capability at the moment.\nSteve: Yeah, no, that's fine.\nSteve: I mean, what you could really do is just build alpha run out as a complete ats.\nSteve: We can then get rid of recruit CRM and then we don't need to augment data, really, from three sources.\nSteve: We can just bring in all the alpha run ATS data, we overlay our cost calculations and it's fucking job done.\nSteve: Like, hurry up and build an ats, man.\nSteve: Stop mucking around.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah, I'll tell the team to get on that.\nSteve: Yeah, yeah, tell them to stop slacking.\nSteve: You know, one of your, one of your smallest clients has said, stop slacking, get your shit together.\nHenry Dornier: No, I think, I think those are.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah, there's definitely, like, ways to simplify things.\nHenry Dornier: But the practical reality also for you guys is you probably also are storing your own statuses for, or, you know, whether someone's advanced or rejected.\nHenry Dornier: And I think.\nSteve: No, we feed directly off the ATS at the moment.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean, though.\nSteve: You're.\nHenry Dornier: You're using status from Recruit CRM, right?\nSteve: Recruit CRM.\nSteve: Yeah, we just, we had a big fight with Jobadder, so we kicked them to the curve and built a recruit CRM integration in a weekend.\nSteve: But we feed it.\nSteve: We're just feeding it off there, I think.\nSteve: I mean, in the end we probably are going to store it because I want to be a little bit more decoupled and have more options for ATSS fairly soon.\nSteve: But at the Moment, we just feed directly from Recruit CRM.\nSteve: So those progress and reject buttons hit the Recruit CRM or the Job Adder API and punch the candidate whichever way they need to go from there as well.\nHenry Dornier: Okay.\nSteve: Which is where I think the idea behind hey, why can't we do this?\nSteve: And alpha runs come from is because it's.\nSteve: It's currently something that we're doing with Recruit CRM and jobada.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah.\nHenry Dornier: The reason we haven't done like crazy statuses again, because the.\nHenry Dornier: Or full support status.\nHenry Dornier: Because usually what we found is most of our customers, they have stages of different statuses in their ats and really what they care about is like mapping to that.\nHenry Dornier: So usually it's like candidates Advanced rejection.\nHenry Dornier: Alpha run moves the stage in their ATS to 1, and then, you know, that's kind of where their source of truth is.\nHenry Dornier: But, you know, at.\nHenry Dornier: Yes, obviously be different.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah.\nSteve: All right, cool, man.\nSteve: Yeah, that'd be great.\nSteve: If you send through those query parameters on the URLs, have a, have a chat.\nSteve: If your tech wonders can think about anything better than a double login or something along those lines, that'll be super cool as well.\nSteve: And then.\nSteve: Yeah, I think that's it.\nSteve: Liz, Jane, Sorry, I've done a lot of talking and I never show up to these things, but do you guys have anything?\nJane Abegail Malicdem: Actually, and we already responded last night about the mobile video support.\nJane Abegail Malicdem: So that's actually one thing that we really need to do for Pyramid because they're requesting mobile, I mean, video interviews.\nJane Abegail Malicdem: But yeah, we'll try to find a workaround it.\nJane Abegail Malicdem: Since Henry mentioned that they're not planning to add it.\nHenry Dornier: Yeah, we found.\nHenry Dornier: Unfortunately, we did some testing around this and just found that mobile video A is pretty tricky because of how many different devices you have to support, but B is not as reliable.\nHenry Dornier: Oftentimes like when you're trying to stream big chunks of video over mobile, you can end up not really getting good quality video out of it.\nHenry Dornier: So we've kind of deferred on that and said, okay, either you're going to do an audio interview on your phone or you're going to do a full video and audio interview on your desktop, or hopefully the connection is more stable.\nHenry Dornier: But yeah, I mean, keep me posted there.\nHenry Dornier: If it's like something where we have a huge geopyram and it's not going to work unless this thing happens, you know, let me know.\nHenry Dornier: But right now it's.\nHenry Dornier: I think it's gonna be hard for us to prioritize because it is.\nHenry Dornier: It actually is fairly tricky to implement, really.\nHenry Dornier: Well.\nJane Abegail Malicdem: Yeah, we
